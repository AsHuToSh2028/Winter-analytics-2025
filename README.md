## 🔧 Methodology

- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and structured multi-indicator climate data from 2000–2015.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Investigated trends in emissions, temperature, and energy use.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted lag features, rolling statistics, and seasonal patterns.
- **Modeling Techniques:**
  - ARIMA for trend-capture in stationary series
  - TimeSeriesSplit for validation
- **Visualization:** Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for insight-driven graphs.

## 📊 Results Snapshot

> 🟢 *Predicted renewable energy share by 2070: 34% (vs. 50% target)*  
> 🔴 *Carbon intensity projected to increase by ~60% (target was 45% decrease)*
> 🟢 *Based on clustering, Bhutan stood for having most considerable change in its SDG indicators from the year 2005 to 2015*

## 💡 Future Scope

- Incorporate deep learning models like LSTM for better temporal dependency capture.
- Add interactive dashboards (e.g., with Streamlit) for visualizing future scenarios.
- Integrate real-time or extended datasets from sources like World Bank and UN SDG APIs.
